# Video Summarizer | BART

 video summary, using local llm


In this task, i'll work on creating a simple video summarizer using a free Huggingface BART transformer model and streamlit.

Video summarization is an essential technique that extracts key information from videos, saving time and effort. We'll be using Python and a Huggingface BART encoder-decoder model with the pipeline class.

The model I used was "sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6"" but you can choose whichever you suits you best from huggingface.co
