# Music Summarizer | BART

 Youtube video summary, using local llm


In this task, i'll work on creating a simple youtube video summarizer using a free Huggingface BART transformer model and streamlit.

Video summarization is an essential technique that extracts key information from videos, saving time and effort. We'll be using Python and a Huggingface BART encoder-decoder model with the pipeline class and also qdrant for vectore storage database also locally

The model I used was "sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6"" but it is flexible to change and choose any other model from huggingface.co
